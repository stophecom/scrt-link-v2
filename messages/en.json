	"polite_clean_canary_walk": "\"The less we know, the better\" — this simple principle is at the heart of this project. It all began with a simple idea: sending private messages in a fun and ephemeral way—messages that don’t persist. Think Snapchat, but without compromising your data. This idea evolved into a project best described as **\"Sharing secrets as a service.\"**\n\nWhile similar products exist — some even serving as great inspiration — scrt.link stands out by seamlessly blending the best concepts in security and privacy with a strong focus on design and user experience.\n\n## Philosophy\nFreedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to privacy are fundamental civil liberties in any free society. With this project, we empower you to exchange information online in a truly secure and private way.\n\nThis product is designed with integrity and privacy at its core. We have no interest in you—neither as a person nor in your secrets.\n\nLearn more on our [privacy page](/privacy).\n\n## User Accounts\nThe primary reason we offer accounts is to prevent spam and fraud. All core features are free to use and don’t require an account.\n\nHowever, certain features require basic authentication—we only ask for an email address (and you're welcome to use a temporary one). These include sending information via email or SMS, where accounts help prevent system abuse.\n\nPaid premium accounts are designed for power users and those who want to support the project.",
	"trick_tidy_monkey_grow": "For us, privacy is not negotiable. We carefully choose and limit our tools in order to protect everyone's right to privacy. We don't use ads, we don't track individuals, we don't sell data and we keep personal data requirements at the bare minimum. Even with an account, we'd never ask for personally identifiable information (PII) without a good reason. \n\n## Privacy Principles:\n\n- **Minimal Data Collection**: We only collect the absolute minimum data necessary to provide the service. No excessive tracking or profiling.\n\n- **End-to-End Encryption** – We encrypt data before transit and at rest, ensuring only the intended recipient can access it.\n\n- **No Third-Party Tracking** – We avoid third-party cookies, trackers, or analytics that compromise user privacy.\n\n- **Anonymous or Pseudonymous Use** – We allow users to access services without requiring personally identifiable information (PII) whenever possible.\n\n- **Ephemeral Data Storage** – We automatically delete user data after a predefined time or give users control over data retention.\n\n- **Open-Source Code** – Our software is open-source.\n\n## Analytics\nWe do basic web traffic analytics with Plausible.io - the simple and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics.\n\n- No use of cookies\n- Fully compliant with privacy regulations GDPR, CCPA and PECR\n- No collection of personal data\n- The project is open source\n- All analytics data is publicly available: Analytics Dashboard\n\n\n## Account & Cookies\nFor power users, we offer user accounts that require authentication. You can create an account with only an email address (You may use a temporary or masked email) - no further information is mandatory.\n\nFor people visiting our website, we only ever use essential cookies. In other words, cookies that are necessary for providing core functionalities: E.g. managing secure authentication. Read more in our Privacy Policy.",
	"actual_patient_giraffe_rest": "All secrets are end-to-end encrypted. We generate a random hash to encrypt your secret on the client using **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode). The encryption key is never stored, but added to the secret link itself. Without the full link, nobody (including us) will ever be able to decrypt your message.\n\nIf a password is provided, we use it to encrypt your secret on top of the standard encryption. Even with access to all our infrastructure, an attacker couldn't read your message. After a secret has been viewed, we delete it permanently from our database. There is no backup.\n\n## Security by Design\n\n- **Zero Trust Architecture** – We assume that no entity (internal or external) is inherently trustworthy.\n\n- **End-to-End Encryption** – All connections are secured via HTTPS. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n- **Minimal Attack Surface** – We reduce complexity and exposure by limiting the number of services, entry points, and dependencies in a system.\n\n- **Regular Updates** – We keep dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Full Transparency** – All code is open-source on [Github](https://github.com/stophecom/scrt-link-v2)\n\n- **Automated Security Testing** – We use automated tools to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies.\n\n## Infrastructure\nTrusted players, few dependencies.\nWe chose industry leaders to host our infrastructure:\n\n- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com):** Website & Postgres Database\n- **[Flow Swiss AG](https://flow.swiss):** Object Storage (Files)",
